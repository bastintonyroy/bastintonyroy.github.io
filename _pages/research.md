Welcome to the home page of Tony Savarimuthu. I am an Associate Professor in the department of [Information Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/info-science/index.html) at the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz), Dunedin, New Zealand. My research interests are in the areas of Multi-Agent Systems (a branch of Artifical Intelligence), Software Engineering, Information Systems, and Computing Education. I teach in many of the areas of my research interest. Recently, I have been coordinating and teaching the introductory data science paper titled [Practical Data Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/papers/index.html?papercode=COMP120).
